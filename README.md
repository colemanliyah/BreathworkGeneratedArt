# BreathworkGeneratedArt

**Authors:** Liyah Coleman and Brian Bishop  

---

## Inspiration
The project was inspired by the desire to **detect inhale and exhale** and capture a **full breath cycle**. By analyzing the difference between pitch and roll from IMU data, we can track breathing patterns and use them to generate dynamic, real-time visual art.

---

## Features
- Real-time detection of **inhale** and **exhale**.
- Calculates a **full breath cycle**.
- Generates visual feedback or outputs based on breathing patterns.

## Additional Notes
- Uses an **Arduino with LSM6DS3 IMU** and **MadgwickAHRS** for orientation calculations.
- Calibration is dynamic: the system adapts to the user’s baseline breath range.
- Can be extended to create **interactive art installations** or **biofeedback visualizations**.
