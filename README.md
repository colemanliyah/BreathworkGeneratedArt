# You Can Breath Through Anything

## Project Overview
BreathCycle Art Experience transforms the act of breathing into a **meditative, interactive visual experience**. We aimed to solve the problem of guiding timed meditation **without relying on phones or screens** while capturing subtle chest movements. By tracking inhale and exhale patterns using a wearable IMU sensor, the system provides intuitive feedback through **visual cues**, helping users settle into a calm, mindful state.

## How It Works

### Hardware
- **Arduino Nano 33 IoT** with built-in **LSM6DS3 IMU** (gyroscope + accelerometer).  
- **Polarized lenses** mounted on a servo motor for visual output.  
- Wearable **necklace design** to position the Arduino near the chest for accurate breath detection.

### Software / Process
1. **Calibration** – Measures the user’s baseline chest motion to define a starting point for inhale/exhale detection.  
2. **Breath Detection** – Differences in pitch and roll indicate inhale (difference decreasing) or exhale (difference increasing).  
3. **Visual Feedback** – 
    - The first four long breaths rotate the lens to darken.  
    - The next four breaths allow meditation without feedback.  
    - The final four breaths rotate the lens back to lighten.  
4. **Cycle Completion** – A full inhale/exhale cycle triggers the system’s output, such as moving the lens, activating LEDs, or sending a signal.

## Features
- Real-time **inhale and exhale detection**.  
- Dynamic calibration for each user’s breath range.  
- Interactive, meditative **visual feedback** without screens or phones.  
- Potential to extend into **biofeedback art installations**.
